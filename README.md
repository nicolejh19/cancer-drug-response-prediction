# cancer-drug-response-prediction

## About the Project
This is part of a Final Year Project to explore transfer learning methods to build deep learning models utilising both preclinical and clinical datasets in order to make use of the large preclinical datasets while transferring knowledge to better predict drug response for cancer patients where limited data is available.
